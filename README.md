# Coders In Hoods Course Interview Prep

This folder contains all the exercises you need to complete before your interview to join Coders In Hoods.

## Requirements

You need to install:

- NodeJS, get it from [here](https://nodejs.org/)
- a code editor, we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Exercise process

These are the steps you'll perform to complete each exercise:

1. In a terminal, navigate to an exercise folder:
    - e.g. `cd 02-js-variables-exercise`
2. In the same terminal, run `npm install` and wait for it to finish installing
3. Open the `README.md` file and read about the topic
    - If you want a nice way to read the file, one option is a Chrome extension: [Markdown Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk/related?hl=en). Make sure to follow the steps for "Local Files"
4. Open the `index.js` file and read the descriptions of the required code
5. Write some code to meet the requirements
6. Run `npm test` to see if your code has met the requirements
7. Keep repeating steps 5 and 6 until all the tests have passed
8. Take a well earned break!
9. Move on to the next exercise
